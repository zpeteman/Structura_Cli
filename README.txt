# File Manager CLI in Rust

A simple, efficient command-line file manager built with **Rust**. This tool allows you to organize files within directories based on their extensions. It automatically categorizes files into appropriate subdirectories (e.g., audio files into `audio_files`, images into `images`, etc.). 

This project is aimed at making file organization on your system easier and can be customized to fit various needs. It supports file manipulation, directory creation, and can be further extended with additional functionalities.

## Features:
- **Directory Navigation**: Navigate through directories and list their contents.
- **Automatic File Categorization**: Sort files into directories based on their extensions (e.g., `.mp3` into `audio_files`, `.png` into `images`).
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on multiple operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Efficient File Handling**: Moves and organizes files without relying on external dependencies.
- **Customizable**: Easily configurable for different directory structures and file types.
